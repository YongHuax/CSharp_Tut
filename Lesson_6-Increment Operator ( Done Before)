Assignment Operators	Usage	Examples
= (Equal to)	result=5	Assign the value 5 for result
+= (Plus Equal to)	result+=5	Same as result=result+5
-= (Minus Equal to)	result-=5	Same as result=result-5
*= (Multiply Equal to)	result*=5	Same as result=result*5
/= (Divide Equal to)	result/=5	Same as result=result/5
%= (Modulus Equal to)	result%=5	Same as result=result%5


++x; //prefix
x++; //postfix

  E.G. int x = 3;
       int y = ++x;
       // x is 4, y is 4
       
       
       The prefix example increments the value of x, and then assigns it to y.
       The postfix example assigns the value of x to y, and then increments x.
       ( remember crossing the bridge ) 
       
       y = ++x .  Y croses ++Bridge to X ,  so y = x+1 ,  X  = x+1
       
       y = x++ . Y dosent need to cross ++bridge so Y= x , X = X+1
       
       Note:  Both cases X increments by 1 , only y diff
